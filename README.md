Summary:
This project uses detailed e-commerce data to improve demand forecasting and inventory optimization, helping retailers reduce stockouts, avoid overstocking, and meet rising delivery expectations. By analyzing Amazon transactions across regions, categories, fulfillment types, and SKUs, the team identifies key drivers of demand variability and operational inefficiencies. Results show that sales concentrate in major cities and a few high-performing categories, with Amazon Fulfillment outperforming Merchant Fulfillment and expedited shipping showing higher cancellation risk. Insights support prioritizing high-demand SKUs, enhancing forecasting, improving fulfillment reliability, and diversifying inventory to reduce risk and strengthen overall performance.
